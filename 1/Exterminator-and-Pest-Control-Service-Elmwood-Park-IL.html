<p>Generally, the primary objective of IPM programs is on agricultural insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ). Although, initially established for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now established to include illness, weeds, and other pests that may hinder the management objectives of websites such as industrial and residential structures, lawn and grass locations, and home and community gardens.</p>

Applying insecticides when natural opponents are not plentiful or are less susceptible, such as when immatures are encased in host eggs, can be handy.
