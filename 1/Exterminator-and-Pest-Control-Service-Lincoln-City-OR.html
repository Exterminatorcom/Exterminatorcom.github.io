The term pest" refers to more than one cause of issues consisting of diseases, undesirable insects, termites, nematodes, mollusks and weeds. A number of treatment techniques have actually been used, consisting of chemical techniques, such as pesticide applications and harmful gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the materials, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
