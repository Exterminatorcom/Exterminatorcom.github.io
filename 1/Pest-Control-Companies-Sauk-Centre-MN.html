<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and thinks about a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>
<p>They create barriers to prevent pests from entering a building and apply pesticides or traps. According to audit standards, pests in warehouses are strong unfavorable indicators of a company's negligence to follow proper sanitation procedures. Their approaches include using traps, pesticides and power spraying-equipped trucks to eliminate or kill pests. Some bugs also cause structural damage, such as wood boring insects like termites, carpenter ants and powderpost beetles.</p>
<p>The success of control methods must be measured utilizing indicators based upon tracking of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and effect on the environment. These consist of the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>It keeps using pesticide and other interventions to levels that are economically and environmentally justified and minimises threats to human health and the environment. In a metaanalysis of data of 145 studies, the efficiency of either predators or parasitoids was demonstrated to be excellent in minimizing the number of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
