It is a term that refers to the way in which growers cultivate and safeguard their crops based on an understanding of cycles around plants, of balances and relationships of reliance in between plants, micro-organisms, insects and nutrients.</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like ants, roaches, or spiders, we will recognize the source of the problem. The objective is to offer a general understanding of the ideas of IPM, together with the principles for implementation in all crops.
