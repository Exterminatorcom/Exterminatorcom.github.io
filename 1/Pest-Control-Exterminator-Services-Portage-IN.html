The company takes emergencies seriously, so if you have a hazardous circumstance, such as a nest of wasps or a scorpion holding you captive in your restroom, Orkin will do its best to offer same-day service. Given that the early potatoes are the only food source readily available, the beetles will gather together on these plants where they can more easily be controlled.</p>
