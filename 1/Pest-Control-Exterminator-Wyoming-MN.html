D's has actually been my only choice for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>Fifty 7 of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were prohibited by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997).
