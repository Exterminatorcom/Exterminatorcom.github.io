Another popular natural pest control technique used by gardeners is the use of useful microbes on plants Unlike using natural predators, using bacteria to control pests is a preemptive approach. Pest Control Solutions offers bird netting services for both residential and business homes. This name conveys a company who will fight the bugs no one wants.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
