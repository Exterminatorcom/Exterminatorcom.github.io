<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even documents kept in lockers and safes, thus triggering gigantic damage within just a few months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client houses and businesses to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves introducing natural opponents from a pest's native range into a brand-new area where native natural enemies do not supply control.</p>

<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses many of the very same principles as IPM but restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
