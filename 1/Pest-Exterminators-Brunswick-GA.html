<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have failed.

<p>If, after following preventive and planned management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or use selected biopesticides with low environmental impact. Professional exterminators utilize various kinds of pesticides and baits to kill and get rid of pests. Efficient, long-term corrective actions can then be taken to avoid pests from entering the structure and infesting the structure and collections.</p>
<p>As the federal authority under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA), the PMRA establishes pest management policies and standards; promotes sustainable pest management; aims to improve the regulatory process to increase effectiveness; enforces compliance with the PCPA; and, disperses pest management details to the public and key stakeholders.</p>
