<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into account a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Educated field teams will have the ability to monitor and identify pest problems and successfully perform the management techniques. The idea of integrated pest management (IPM) came from almost 60 years ago in response to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Several of the resources listed at the end of this brochure can be utilized for identification of insect pests affecting collections.</p>

The pest management industry is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and roughly 150,000 pest control service personnel. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, insects, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, flies and bees are typically found pests in our society.</p>
