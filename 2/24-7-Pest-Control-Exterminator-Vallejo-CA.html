It is a term that describes the way in which growers cultivate and protect their crops based upon an understanding of cycles in and around plants, of balances and relationships of reliance between plants, insects, nutrients and micro-organisms.</p>
<p>In referral to the principle of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later broadened to welcome collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>The success of control methods must be determined using indications based upon monitoring of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and impact on the environment. These consist of the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, development of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative influence on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
<p>A pest can be a plant (weed), vertebrate (bird, rodent, or other mammal), invertebrate (insect, tick, mite, or snail), nematode, pathogen (germs, infection, or fungi) that triggers illness, or other undesirable organism that may hurt water quality, animal life, or other parts of the ecosystem.
