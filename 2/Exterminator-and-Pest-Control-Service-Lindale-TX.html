<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are dedicated to providing the very best possible service to protect versus undesirable pests. The following example describes the 6 components of an Integrated Pest Management program utilized to handle carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest avoidance, a successful IPM program utilizes a mix of control techniques consisting of biological control, habitat manipulation, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the idea of integrating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later expanded to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>The success of control strategies need to be determined utilizing signs based on tracking of harmful organisms, beneficials, pesticide use, and influence on the environment. These include the revival of pest populations after decimation of the natural opponents, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and unfavorable impacts on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
