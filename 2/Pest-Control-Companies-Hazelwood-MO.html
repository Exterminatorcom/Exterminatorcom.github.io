Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture arising from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be controlled by particular alternatives, however they may not all be offered in a particular place, for a particular crop, or within the readily available financial means. IPM includes using the very best mix of cultural, chemical and biological procedures for particular situations, including plant biotechnology as appropriate.
