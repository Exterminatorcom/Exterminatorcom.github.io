<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly attain levels at which damage is triggered thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich community likely will have a lot of big, expensive homes, so pest control expenses could be higher there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
