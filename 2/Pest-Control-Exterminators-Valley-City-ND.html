<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a efficient and ecologically delicate  technique to pest control. These may or might not include products listed on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides utilized in natural farming and organic gardening are normally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or eco-friendly than synthetic pesticides and can trigger damage.</p>
<p>IPM is utilized in farming, horticulture, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, consisting of structural pest management, grass pest management and ornamental pest management. Deal with a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, deal with termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with an expert bait gun, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a knapsack sprayer.</p>
