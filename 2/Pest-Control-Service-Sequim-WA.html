The cornerstone of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though disputed by some as a legitimate procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so excruciating at times that the only alternative left is to work with a regional pest control company to remove pests.

<p>The approach to be selected for IPM depends upon many aspects, the important of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and financial element of the management. Insect pests trigger considerable losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.
