<h3>Services Offered By Pest Control Companies Wheeling IL</h3>
<p>This approach refers to making use of a range of mechanical or physical strategies for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing environmental conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
