<h2>How To Hire a Best Pest Control Service in Temple Hills</h2>

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a reliable and ecologically delicate  technique to pest control. These may or might not consist of products noted on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides utilized in organic farming and natural gardening are typically much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more environmentally friendly or safe than artificial pesticides and can trigger harm.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical ways to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the smallest efficient dosage when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of methods such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>

<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be very efficient in triggering significant reductions in pest populations in specific scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ).

<p>This information, in mix with available pest control approaches, is utilized to manage pest damage by the most cost-effective means, and with the minimal hazard to people, property, and the environment. Applications of pesticides are constantly the last option in an IPM program. This is discussed in Chapter 16.
