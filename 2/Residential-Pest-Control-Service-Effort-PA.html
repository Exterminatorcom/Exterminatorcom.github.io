<p>By establishing a personalized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the ideal controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active elements of multitrophic level interactions is important to a total systems approach to pest management. Commercial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of handling and removing pests.</p>
<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
