<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>

Our goal is to eliminate all kinds of pests such as black ants, red ants, spiders, cockroaches and other bugs from your residential or industrial property.
