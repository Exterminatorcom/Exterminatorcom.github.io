<p>Based on the records on the use of pesticides and on the monitoring of damaging organisms the professional user must inspect the success of the used plant defense steps. For example, sun-loving plants are more vulnerable to pests and other issues when planted in dubious locations, and vice versa. 3. Biological controls such as choosing competitive, preferable plants that make it difficult for weeds to grow, or drawing in useful insects to control insect pests.</p>
