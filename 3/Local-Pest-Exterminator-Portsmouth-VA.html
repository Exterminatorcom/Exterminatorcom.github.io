<p>We got 195 points out of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are drawn in to a number of areas that can supply any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3.

While chemical pesticides ought to be used as the last option, in principle, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of specific endemic or intrusive pests and illness or to safeguard the seed and transplants from common and persistent pest problems.</p>
