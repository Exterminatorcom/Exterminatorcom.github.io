<p>Socio-psychological factors including reasonable and moral factors to consider were discovered to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).

Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control requires time and efforts. Pests are undesirable plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that hinder human activity.</p>
<p>Also, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the same location may affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of illness.
