<p>The determination of the right cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the detriment of the pest.

These include the renewal of pest populations after decimation of the natural enemies, advancement of insecticide-resistant populations, and negative effect on nontarget organisms within and outside the crop system.</p>
