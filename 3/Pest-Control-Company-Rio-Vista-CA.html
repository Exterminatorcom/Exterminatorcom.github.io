<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is deemed a cost-effective and ecologically benign pest control technique preferably suited for both little and big farmers worldwide. When termites have gone into a building, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be deemed a decision-making procedure in which observations (from examination and tracking) are used to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>You only need to spend an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by global concerns: the vicious circle that develops from using large quantities of synthetic fertilizer, which increases dependence on pesticides, which in turn causes resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most essential element of artificial fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have run out.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can rapidly achieve levels at which damage is triggered therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, expensive homes, so pest control costs could be greater there due to the fact that there's more area for a pest control company to cover in one of those houses.</p>
