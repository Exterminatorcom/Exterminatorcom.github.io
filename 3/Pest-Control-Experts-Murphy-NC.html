<p>You are safe, sure and secure with HICARE's termite pest control services. Insects are infamously difficult to control. Pests look for places with an abundant food source, in addition to a safe environment in which they can reproduce. Other fairly low-risk pesticides are readily available for some pests. Inoculative biological control indicates launching natural enemies periodically or seasonally to restore a balance that has actually not been maintained naturally or has been interfered with by other control methods.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control procedures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry contaminants in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
