Early detection of arthropod pests helps avoid the requirement to handle comprehensive populations that may cause crop damage. Security problems and eco-friendly disruptions continue to take place (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for efficient, safe, and financially acceptable options (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most widely used method of pest control.</p>
