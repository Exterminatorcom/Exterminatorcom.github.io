<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program is a ecologically delicate and efficient approach to pest control. These may or may not include products listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides utilized in natural farming and natural gardening are normally safer than artificial pesticides, they are not always more ecologically friendly or safe than artificial pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is hunted, record arthropod pest numbers, area within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants inspected.

<p>IPM programs work to keep track of for pests and recognize them precisely, so that suitable control choices can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. However, the major pattern has been toward making use of contemporary chemistry and molecular biology to change traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these methods are still therapies.</p>
