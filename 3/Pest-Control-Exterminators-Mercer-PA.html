<p>In addition to establishing clear indicators that a pest control program is indeed an IPM system, it is likewise essential to provide requirements to determine performance of the system. Usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours is needed to carry out the basic pest control treatment. Public need is influenced by retail marketing techniques, issues for food safety based upon pesticide policies in their area, and a lack of knowledge on food production to name a few elements.</p>
<p>Pests managed: Use horticultural oils to fight aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.

Numerous pest control chemicals are hazardous and could be hazardous, if not used effectively.</p>
