<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess greater levels of resistance.</p>
