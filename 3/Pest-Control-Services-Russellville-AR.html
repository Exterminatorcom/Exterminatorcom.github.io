The chemical controls are used just after routine tracking shows that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many specific product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are readily available in minimal locations.</p>
<p>Their expert exterminators are offered for 24 hours of emergency services for their important customers. However, the high capacity for recreation of insect pests stays, and a population explosion of lots of species can be gotten out of a low-density level whenever ideal environmental conditions happen or control slackens. Under this plan, pest control was "supervised" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based on conclusions reached from regular monitoring of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
