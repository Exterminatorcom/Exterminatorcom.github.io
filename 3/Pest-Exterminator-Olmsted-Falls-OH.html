<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed regional farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable economic condition, environmental and social effects 13 and applies to most agricultural, public health and facility pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>IPCA strongly suggests hiring competent and qualified pest control experts from IPCA Member organisations across the country. Agriculture takes on the concern with integrated pest management. The term pest" refers to more than one reason for issues including diseases, unwanted insects, termites, weeds, nematodes and mollusks. A variety of treatment techniques have been used, consisting of chemical methods, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified environments, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare). For instance, a rich community likely will have a great deal of large, pricey homes, so pest control costs might be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those homes.</p>
