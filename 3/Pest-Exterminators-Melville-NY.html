<p>More information is needed about food-chain concentration and practical ways of getting rid of harmful effects of pesticide residues that may stay in the environment after the pesticides have served their purpose. Do not base pest management programs on total elimination of a pest.

<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for handling pests, has been in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and more feeding on the saved crop.</p>
