A survey of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka showed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey performed by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
